    "A lot of the motivation behind my data wrangling came directly from the [weather, soil and drought Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data). Christoph Minixhofer, the author of the Kaggle project, posted several [Jupyter notebooks on GitHub](https://github.com/MiniXC/droughted_scripts) on how he was able to gather the weather, soil and drought data from various United State goverment public APIs [<sup>2, 3, 4</sup>](#acknowledgements). I ended up reproducing a lot of his work because I wanted more fine grain weather, drought and soil data. His data coverered all of the United States and was only as narrow as each state's counties. I noticed a lot of the California counties were drastically different from each other in terms of terrain and weather patterns. I was worried that assuming each county was uniform was going to cause problems with the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also downloaded the [latest curated fire data from the United States Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5) by Karen Short as of 2021 [<sup>1</sup>](#acknowledgements). I wanted more data to overlap with the weather data since the weather API only started at 2000 and the original [wildfire Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data) only went to 2015. The newest Forest Service data went out 2018 and contained corrections to the orginal data."

    "  - &#x2611; Download [wildfire Sqlite DB](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5) [<sup>`</sup>](#acknowledgements)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Download [soil CSV from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data) which was originally sourced form the Harmonized World Soil Database [<sup>4</sup>](#acknowledgements)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Import soil CSV into Sqlite\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Remove non-California data to keep the dataset more focused\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Remove wildfire and soil/weather data that does not overlap (pre 2000 wildfires)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Load county FIPS codes and geospatial latitude, longitude and polygon perimeter [<sup>5</sup>](#acknowledgements) into Sqlite\n",
    "  - Add indexes/foreign keys to speed up Sqlite\n",
    "    - &#x2611; year\n",
    "    - &#x2611; FIPS\n",
    "    - &#x2611; long/lat on fires and soil\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Truncate latitude and longitude to 1/10th degree (~11.11 km)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Backfill fires data missing the county by cross referencing the long/lat with each county's geospatial perimeter\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Query NASA's weather API by date and long/lat between 2000-01-01 and 2018-12-31 [<sup>2</sup>](#acknowledgements)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Query U.S. Drought Monitor API by date and FIPS county between 2000-01-01 and 2018-12-31 [<sup>3</sup>](#acknowledgements)\n",
    "  - &#x2611; Incidate if there was a prior fire at the same geospatial location within the last 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Ideas\n",
    "  - Running total of precipitation for past year (really slow)\n",
    "  - Narrow down latitude and longitude to 1/10th degree (~11 km)\n",
    "  - Download soil data by long/lat, instead of the current by county, [<sup>4</sup>](#acknowledgements)"
